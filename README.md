# flask-mongodb
A simple REST Api using Flask-Restful and MongoDB, used to store tweets with timestamps and associated emotions. The Api supports `get`, `put`, `post` and `delete` functions and has multiple endpoints for more complicated `get` requests.

Adapted from [this tutorial](http://salmanwahed.github.io/2015/05/01/flask-restful-mongodb-api/).
